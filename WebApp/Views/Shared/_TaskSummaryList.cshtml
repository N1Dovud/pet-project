    here, you decide if overdue highlight is needed. then if yes, do the calculation
    and pass the value to the card
    here, you also decide if delete button should be there or not.
    You pass in the list type and listId
    Edit should be where?

    do I actually need the list partial view because list is just a bunch of cards only. maybe to avoid
    writing the for loop with automatic handling???
